Strange place to find surnames but when doing a search this site came up so I wrote a small program to grab the surnames and put them into a textfile.

With over 8,000 surnames it's a pretty good dataset that could be used for generating usernames, customers etc. for testing purposes.

If you just need the names grab the zip file it's not going to change much for the next couple of decades
